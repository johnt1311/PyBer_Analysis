## Overview of the Analysis
V. Isualize, the CEO of PyBer, has tasked Omar and me with conducting an analysis of their ride data. She has asked that we look at the total fare by city type and graph it for our analysis. Using pandas and matplotlib, we did an analysis of the data using pandas and then graphed it with matplotlib in Python's Jupiter Notebooks.
## Results
From the graphics above, it's easy to see that urban cities account for the most fares, followed by suburban areas and lastly, rural areas. While urban areas account for the most revenue, they have the lowest average fare per ride, and thus are not as profitable. Rural areas have the highest fare per ride and the highest fare per driver. 
From the line graph, we can see how much the fares can fluctuate, especially in Urban areas. While the total urban fares steadily increased from January to the middle of February, it started to get inconsistent during March. Some of which may be attributed to the differences between weekdays and weekends. Suburban areas since March have had a slow but steady increase and rides, while rural areas had a small uptick at the end of March, but have steadily been decreasing throughout April. 
All three areas had a slight uptick towards the end of February, which was probably due to a holiday that caused demand to increase.
## Summary
In summary, we have three reccomendations for V. Isualize:
1. Work to increase demand in Rural areas because that is where the the highest revenue per ride is. In addition, demand has clearly taken a downtorn in rural areas that will hurt revenues. This needs to be addressed.
2. Increase prices in Urban areas. Urban areas tend to be more affluent and if rural areas are charging higher prices, there should be room to capture some of this additional revenue in Urban areas.
3. Lastly, PyBer should address the differences in fares per driver in the different areas. Having happy drivers is part of the key to success and if urban drivers are not making much money and that is where the most demand is, the quality of service will decrease.
